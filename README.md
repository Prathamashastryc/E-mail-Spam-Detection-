<h1>📧 Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h1>

<b>🚀 Overview:</b>

This project is a complete end-to-end email spam detection pipeline built using Python. It preprocesses raw email datasets, trains multiple machine learning models, and classifies new emails as Spam or Ham in real time. The system also includes a Tkinter-based desktop GUI, offering users a simple offline interface for quick and private spam detection.

<b>🧠 About:</b>

E-Mail Spam Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms demonstrates how classical machine learning models can deliver high-accuracy email classification with minimal computational cost.
The system uses the Enron Email Dataset and implements the following models:

Naïve Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Each model is trained on preprocessed data using TF–IDF vectorization, achieving over 98% accuracy while maintaining fast inference and low memory usage.

<b>✨ Features:</b>

✅ End-to-End ML Pipeline – From raw data preprocessing to model training and testing.
✅ Multiple Classifiers – Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest implemented for comparison.
✅ TF–IDF Vectorization – Converts text data into meaningful numeric representations.
✅ Offline Desktop GUI – Built with Tkinter for real-time spam detection without internet dependency.
✅ High Accuracy – Achieves up to 98.87% accuracy on the Enron dataset.
✅ Privacy-Focused – Runs completely offline; no data is uploaded or shared.
✅ Lightweight and Fast – Designed for personal or organizational use with minimal system requirements.
